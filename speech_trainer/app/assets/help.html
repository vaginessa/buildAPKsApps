<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
Speech Trainer gives immediate feedback on how your voice sounds
like. People don't hear the real sound of their voice while
speaking. This is why many are surprised and often annoyed when they
listen to a recording of their speech. This makes it also difficult to
catch and correct errors.
</p>

<p> If you are practising pronunciation of a foreign language,
improving articulation, diction or treating speech disorders, Speech
Trainer is for you. It simplifies the process of recording and playing
high quality voice samples. Traditional recording applications are
much less convenient for training purposes and require many clicks to
accomplish the same task.</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>
Speech Trainer has two modes of operation that are configured in the
'Settings' menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speech detection mode continuously records until a complete voice
sample is detected (for example a word or a sentence). When such
sample is recorded, recording is terminated, the sample is played and
recording is started again.</li>

<li>Interactive mode allows you to decide when to terminate the
recording. Push and hold the top area of the screen to record, release
to play what was recorded. In this mode you can also replay the last
recorded sample with a button at the bottom of the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>
It is recommended to use headphones during the training. Headphones
give much more accurate output than most built-in speakers.
</p>
<p>
The hints that are shown at the beginning of the training can be turn
off in the 'Settings' menu.
</p>
<p>
Speech Trainer is not a general purpose recording application. If
you need a full blown recorder, there are many apps to choose from,
Rehearsal Assistant is a good one.
